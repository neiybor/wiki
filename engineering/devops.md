### Downloading
Download from web page and not the zip file that gets emailed. ssls.com does not include the p7b file in the emailed zip file.

### Creating PEM file
Some services require the certificate to be uploaded in a .pem format.
```
openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in star.neiybor.com.p7b -out star.neiybor.com.pem
```

### Uploading to Amazon
In Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) upload the certificate as follows.
1. In the `Certificate body` input paste the contents of the .crt file.
2. In the `Certificate private key` input paste the contents of the .key file.
3. In the `Certificate chain` input paste the contents of the .ca-bundle file.

## Certificate uses
When changing the Neighbor.com certificate here are places that will need to be updated:
* cloudfront distro for intercom
* cloudfront distro for naked domain
* cloudfront distro for www.neighbor.com
* heroku frontend server
* blog server
  * on ec2 machine at `/home/ubuntu/ssl/star.neighbor.com.pem` and
  * ELB listener for port 443
* cms / drupal server
  * privkey.pem should be generated by running `cat /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/server.crt /home/bitnami/STAR_neighbor_com.ca-bundle > /opt/bitnami/apache2/conf/privkey.pem`
* heroku wiki server
