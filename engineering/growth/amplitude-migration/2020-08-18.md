# Questions for Kavitha
1. Since you can track page calls on mobile, why would you use the screen call? [link](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/amplitude/#page-and-screen)
2. Can you send additional properties with the page calls? E.g., device, prerendered
3. Can you confirm that if we have both the Track Named Pages and Track Categorized Pages enabled in Segment and we have a call with a name and category defined, it will send two events to Amplitude? ["Important: If you enable more than one of the following settings, multiple events will be sent for the same call."](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/amplitude/#page-and-screen)
