<!-- TITLE: The Mind Garden -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Bi-Weekly presentations on stuff to make you think -->

# Introduction
*The Mind Garden* is a bi-weekly (every two weeks) hour long session of presentations that someone has decided might be a topic of interest to engineers at Neighbor. The presenters are self-selected (could be you) and the topics are also self-selected (could be yours). Basically, if you've got something that you think might be of interest to the Neighbor Engineering community, sign up and tell us about it!

To be clear about "topics of interest," it could literally be anything that _you_ think is interesting that you think other's might also think is interesting. Maybe it's a practial application of Docker for your dev environment that makes something easier for you? Or maybe you have something to say about Quantum Computers? Or maybe you want to show an introduction to ReasonML? Or maybe you have a great StarCraft II Zerg rush strategy? Or maybe you've 3D printed the Neighbor logo and want to show it off? Or maybe... ... ...

For the inaugural event, we will be hearing presentations on Levenshtein edit distances and genetic algorithms.
