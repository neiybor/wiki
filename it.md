## Office
### Internet Access
#### Employee network
Name: Neighbor
Pwd: won'tyoubemyN6r
#### Guest network
Name: NeighborGuest
Pwd: FredRogers
The guest network is rate limited so it can't interfere too much with our work. I tested the network on an old iPhone in the farthest corner of the office and was able to stream an HD video. Let me know if you have issues though.

### Front Door Access

We have a smart deadbolt on the upstairs front door to make it easy for everyone to enter/exit and keep our office secure. The simplest way to access the door is via a personal code. 

Send a 6+ digit code to derrick@

Follow the instructions [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eDBVaRrti_UunEyMUbyD16JySkNCcCLv) for using the code to unlock/lock the door.

NOTE: Do NOT lock the front door handle so we can use the deadbolt for access to our office.
