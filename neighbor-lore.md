<!-- TITLE: Neighbor Lore -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: bulleted backstory! -->

* The idea of Neighbor started when Preston needed a place to store stuff, didn't want to pay the storage fees, and knew there was plenty of space all around him in Orem/Provo but had to drive to Logan to store his stuff in someone's house
* Hot Dog Day is everything you'd hoped it would be (i.e. we eat hot dogs to celebrate a host event where we ate waaay too many left over hot dogs in the convening days)
* All the references to Pizza (in code and slackbots) are because Wednesday Lunch first started out as Wednesday ordering-in of pizza. Plus, everybody loves pizza, right?!
* It's been alleged that Sean Bird named his first son after Neighbor CEO Joseph Woodbury
* Chris Pratt not only shares a name with the famous actor, but his [github handle](https://github.com/prattprattpratt) is the same as the actor's [twitter handle](https://twitter.com/prattprattpratt)
* The [original Neighbor logo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx5DR2SdaEEwYWdUenNDN1dBRXM/view?usp=sharing) was created by searching "free logo maker" on Google, clicking the first result, searching its internal image catalog for "house" and using one of the first few results.
* Neighbor's first office was a tiny 10x10 room on  BYU's campus where the A/C and heating unit was always on the fritz.
* Neighbor's fourth office was a small house in American Fork that is similar vintage and style to house on the Mr. Rogers TV program.
* The signature Neighbor whistle signified a sale for a long time, it has since evolved into an expression of congratulations equivilent to clapping for someone.
